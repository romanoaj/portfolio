/**
 * content.js
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every word on this site lives here, separate from layout (index.html)
 * and interaction (main.js). This is almost the only file you need to
 * edit to make the site yours.
 *
 * SITE_INFO — name, tagline, and contact links used in the header,
 * hero, and footer.
 *
 * ENTRIES — one object per section in the "Contents" index, keyed by
 * the id used in each data-entry="..." attribute in index.html.
 *
 * Two shapes of section, depending on how it should behave when opened:
 *
 *   1) SIMPLE DROPDOWN (about, education, skills, resume, interests,
 *      hobbies, contact) — clicking the row opens it right there on the
 *      page. Shape:
 *        { title, folio, body: Block[] }
 *
 *   2) CARD-GRID SECTION (research, experience, projects) — clicking the
 *      row opens a grid of small cards, two per row; clicking a card
 *      opens a popup with that one entry's full detail. Shape:
 *        { title, folio, intro?: Block[], entries: Entry[] }
 *      where an Entry is:
 *        { heading, meta, bullets, teaser? }
 *      `teaser` is the one-line preview shown on the card; if you leave
 *      it out, the first bullet is used instead.
 *
 * Block types (used in `body` and `intro`):
 *   { type: "paragraph", text }
 *   { type: "image", caption, src }              -> real photo, or a
 *                                                    placeholder until
 *                                                    that file exists
 *   { type: "quote", text }                        -> italic pull-quote
 *   { type: "tags", label, items: [...] }           -> a row of chip tags
 *   { type: "entry", heading, meta, bullets }       -> an inline job/degree
 *                                                       (used by Education,
 *                                                       which stays a plain
 *                                                       dropdown, not cards)
